# Setting up your Mac

# My personal dotfile

It contains the installation of some basic tools, some handy aliases and functions. Backups of settings are done via [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup).

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfile` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

```
git clone git@github.com:StanBarrows/dotfile.git .dotfile
cd .dotfile
./bootstrap
```
The bootstrap script can be run by cd-ing into the `.dotfile` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./install.sh
```
